# Quick-Translator 

Quick Translator is a tool for XrmToolbox that allows you update translation of Dynamics 365 components inside the toolbox without downloading any excel files.
You can use the data grid to quickly update the translation of the components that are seperated to tabs by component type.
It's still in development phase, once it's released you will be able to use it by XrmToolbox.
